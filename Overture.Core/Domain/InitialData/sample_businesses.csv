",Anita Greeck,,"As an Eco friendly gardener I like to work in an environmental-friendly way. This means that I will try to establish the natural balance in the garden without using chemicals. Eventually, this is the best remedy against weeds and maybe some weeds are more useful than you think. 

I am more than happy to give you advice and help you make your garden a beautiful place to enjoy. I can also advise you on how to make your garden more bird, bee and butterfly-friendly. I can also help you with small landscaping and design. I have already established different veggie gardens for some families so if you want your own just give me a call.

I prefer to work on the north side of Brisbane. 

I am able to do all the light maintenance work. This includes: 
• Lawn mowing 
• Pruning 
• Weeding 
• Planting 
• Helping you with your veggie garden or with starting one 

I am insured and have an ABN number. My rate is $35 per hour for maintenance. I can bring my own tools or use yours. I can't take any green waste with me.

Wedding Photography Overview:

""…You will blink and before you know it, not only will your wedding day have whizzed by, but you will be happily celebrating your 10th wedding anniversary…

Nostalgia in Greek literally means ‘the pain from an old wound‘. A twinge in your heart far more powerful than memory alone.

Mel Gaunson from Little Studio loves to capture those unmissable details at Weddings… the stunning bouquets, the dress, his expression as she appears at the end of aisle; however the thing she focuses on most is capturing the raw emotion surrounding the day.

Those fleetingly rare moments that would be gone forever had she not been waiting & watching for that precise time to press the shutter...

Dianna, One of Mels recent Brides wrote “It is true that a picture paints a thousand words, and it is equally true that Mel’s photos paint a thousand emotions.”

Life is a journey full of ups and downs and that twinge of pain stemming from leaving one important chapter of your life behind to start the next is lessened when you have photographs that leave you breathless with nostalgia.

Moments captured, to be treasured forever… Your memories. Your pictures. Your future.",Photography,
